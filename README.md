WordPress Plugin Extension Template
============================

A template for building a WordPress plugin extension.

#### Usage

Just edit the `plugin-extension.php` file to reflect your custom plugin extension's name, prefixes and requirements. Add in a path to your various plugin files (place all your plugin actions, hooks, filter, functions, et cetera in a separate file to avoid errors with older PHP versions).

Use, contribute, enjoy.
